### A note about environments

Artsy applications all [ultimately] depend on the production Unleash server instance to decide feature state, whether running in development, staging, or production environments themselves.

**Development** environments of server-side applications should connect to [the production server](https://unleash.artsy.net) with a "development" key, while client-side applications should connect to [the staging proxy](https://unleashprx-staging.artsy.net) which itself connects to the production server with a "development" key.

**Staging** environments of server-side applications should also connect to [the production server](https://unleash.artsy.net) with a "development" key, while client-side applications should connect to [the staging proxy](https://unleashprx-staging.artsy.net) which itself connects to the production server with a "development" key.

**Production** environments of server-side applications should connect to [the production server](https://unleash.artsy.net) with a "production" key, while client-side applications should connect to [the production proxy](https://unleashprx.artsy.net) which itself connects to the production server with a "production" key.
